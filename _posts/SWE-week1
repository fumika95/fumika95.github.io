## What did you do this past week?##
	This week we learned some very basic knowledges about python program, and how it is different or useful in some sense compared to other popular languages. We also got some insights about the problem that we will solve in the first project.

## What's in your way?##
	The biggest problem I have to successfully complete this course is that I am completely(not completely but you get what I mean) new of Javascript and Python. It was good that I could pick up some basic stuff about JavaScript by doing the reading assignments, but stil need to actually work on the project to actually be able to use python and javascript fluently.

## What will you do next week?##
	I am planning to start working on the project, while picking up knowledge about how to write program in Python(Pretty sure that going to the lab session will help me a lot so that's what I am going to do).

## What's my experience of the class?##
	I like taking professor Downing's class because I learn some real stuff in his class. I has great experience with his oop class last semester so that is why I am here again. Hopefully I will do better than before in this class.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?##
	In class professor mentioned that in Java, "this" can never be used in static class. This might be a very basic thing, but it is something about what I didn't really pay attention before. It made me rethink the way I learn a language while coding.
