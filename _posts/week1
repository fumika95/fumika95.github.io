## What did you do this past week?##
  This past week I was busy setting up the environment for the classes this semester. It took me a while to figure out how to install all the tools we need for the object oriented programming class, and what kind of tasks I need to complete every week. We also went over some basic knowledge about c++, and talked about how to write effective unit tests using some tools such as gtest and gcov.

## What's in my way?##
  First of all I still need to get all the textbooks to complete the reading assignments. Also I need to refactor the way I learn in the class. I missed a question in last quiz because the material was from the lecture but not on the note posted on piazza. I could not take a very useful note this past week because there were so much information given in the class and I am not very good at taking notes while listening to the class. I need to figure out a way that I can learn as much as possible from the class.
## What will you do next week?##
  I am trying to ready all the codes posted on the schedule before the class so that I will be able to write down some points for each line very quickly instead of taking time to write down codes during the class. Hopefully this will help me not to miss a point we talked about in the class
## Tip of the week##
  I did not even know that we could build our own pages using GitHub. Also I found the â€“A option for grep very useful. It is a great command option to help me save time.
